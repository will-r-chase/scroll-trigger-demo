      GSAP is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to code high-performance
      and complex animations. GSAP has a flexible interface that is easy to use
      with D3 and other common dataviz libraries. GSAP has just released a new
      plugin called ScrollTrigger that facilitates scroll-driven animations.
      ScrollTrigger can be used along with GSAP’s own animation functions, but
      you can also use it just as a scroll watcher to trigger any function (for
      example, run some D3 code) on a particular scroll interaction. This
      document showcases how you can use ScrollTrigger to power some common
      dataviz scrollytelling patterns, but the library is extremely
      full-featured and flexible, you can see more about what’s possible
      <a href="https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger" target="_blank"
        >in the docs</a
      >. Oh, and if you want to see all the scroller and trigger markers for each scroll interaction in this demo, use the menu at the top right ↗.

    <p><i>*Disclaimer: ScrollTrigger is very new, and hence I have had very little practice with it and I doubt it has even been used by anyone in a real dataviz project yet. That means there’s very few best practices at this point. What follows works for me, but it is subject to change, and I make no claims that this is the best or “correct” way to do things.</i></p>

      <section class="step" id="step-1">
        One common scrollytelling pattern is to have a chart become ‘pinned’,
        while boxes of explainer text are scrolled, like this. GSAP has a
        built-in method for pinning elements like this. This chart is pinned by
        creating a new <span class="code">ScrollTrigger</span> which triggers
        when the <span class="code">#chart-wrapper</span> element reaches the
        middle of the viewport. The trigger sets
        <span class="code">pin: true</span> to pin the trigger element (in this
        case our chart wrapper) in place until the end of the trigger, which is
        set to the bottom of the last text box.
        <pre>
            <code>
ScrollTrigger.create({
    trigger: '#chart-wrapper',
    endTrigger: '#step-4',
    start: 'center center',
    end: () => {
        const height = window.innerHeight;
        const chartHeight = document.querySelector('#chart-wrapper').offsetHeight;
        return `bottom ${chartHeight + (height - chartHeight) / 2}px`;
    },
    pin: true,
    pinSpacing: false
});
            </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step-2">
        You can then trigger GSAP animations. Here, we’re using a normal
        <span class="code">gsap.to()</span> tween to animate the
        <span class="code">cx</span> attribute of our points. To trigger the
        animation on scroll, we just add a
        <span class="code">scrollTrigger</span> object to our normal GSAP tween.
        The animation fires when the second text box (our
        <span class="code">trigger</span> ) crosses the middle of the screen,
        and reverses when you scroll backwards. Using GSAP tweens has the
        advantage that you can easily pause, restart, complete, or reverse your
        tweens using <span class="code">toggleActions</span>.

        <pre>
            <code>
gsap.to('.points', {
    scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: '#step-2',
        start: 'top center',
        toggleActions: 'play none none reverse'
    },
    cx: () => Math.random() * svgWidth,
    duration: 0.5,
    ease: 'power3.inOut'
});
            </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step-3">
        You can also just use GSAP to set the ScrollTrigger, and let D3 or
        another library handle the animation. In this case, we set up a new
        <span class="code">ScrollTrigger</span> with GSAP, and passed it
        callback functions (<span class="code">circlesToTimeline</span> and
        <span class="code">circlesToRandom</span>) which contain our custom D3
        animation code via the arguments
        <span class="code">onEnter</span> (forward animation) and
        <span class="code">onLeaveBack</span> onLeaveBack (backwards animation).
        The <span class="code">onEnter</span> callback will fire when our
        <span class="code">trigger</span> crosses the scroller start from the
        top, and onLeaveBack will fire when the
        <span class="code">trigger</span> crosses the scroller start from the
        bottom.

        <pre>
            <code>
ScrollTrigger.create({
    trigger: '#step-3',
    start: 'top center',
    onEnter: circlesToTimeline,
    onLeaveBack: circlesToRandom
});
            </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step-4">
        Also, notice how all these text boxes are transitioning from transparent
        to opaque when they enter and leave the viewport? That’s GSAP too. We
        set up a <span class="code">ScrollTrigger</span> for each box (it was
        easy with GSAP’s <span class="code">toArray</span> function and a
        <span class="code">forEach</span> loop), and used the
        <span class="code">toggleClass</span> argument to toggle an ‘active’ CSS
        class (which just adds opacity to the element) whenever the element is
        in view.

        <pre>
            <code>
gsap.utils.toArray('.step').forEach(step => {
    ScrollTrigger.create({
        trigger: step,
        start: 'top 80%',
        end: 'center top',
        toggleClass: 'active'
    });
});
            </code>

      So far we’ve been animating SVG elements, but GSAP can animate components
      of basically any renderer: SVG, DOM, Canvas, or WebGL. And it’s built to
      work with popular libraries like pixi.js and three.js. So, let’s try using
      it to animate some DOM elements, in this case a bunch of stacked text
      blocks. We’ll also show off another cool features of
      ScrollTrigger—scrubbing. In the examples above, the whole animation fired
      as soon as the trigger was activated, but you can also link the animation
      progress to the scroll progress, so that when you’re scrolled 50% into an
      element, the animation is 50% complete. In GSAP, this is as easy as
      setting <span class="code">scrub: true</span> on your
      <span class="code">scrollTrigger</span>. You can also set scrub to a
      number, which will basically put a delay on the animation so that it
      catches up to the scroll position that many seconds later. Here we’ve
      stacked six text blocks, each colored differently, and set them to move
      down the page with a scrubbing animation. Each text block has a slight
      scrub delay (the purple text has almost no delay, and the red text has the
      longest delay), to demonstrate the ‘catch-up’ feature. The code looks like
      this:

          <pre class="text-centered">
            <code>
gsap.utils.toArray('.scrub').forEach((el, i) => {
    gsap.to(el, {
        scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: '.scrub-wrapper',
            start: 'top top',
            end: 'bottom center+=150',
            pin: '.scrub-wrapper',
            scrub: (7 - i) * 0.1
        },
        y: '45vh'
    });
});
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>

    <div class="scrub-wrapper">
      <h1 class="red stack scrub">
        scroll me!
      </h1>
      <h1 class="orange stack scrub">
        scroll me!
      </h1>
      <h1 class="yellow stack scrub">
        scroll me!
      </h1>
      <h1 class="green stack scrub">
        scroll me!
      </h1>
      <h1 class="blue stack scrub">
        scroll me!
      </h1>
      <h1 class="purple stack scrub">
        scroll me!
      </h1>
    </div>

      This has barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with GSAP and
      ScrollTrigger, but hopefully you can see how powerful this library is for
      dataviz and scrollytelling. Although this post has emphasized how simple
      ScrollTrigger makes all of this, the truth is that there’s always gotcha’s
      that come up with scrollytelling, it’s usually not that simple. Making sure
      that your CSS and HTML structure don’t fight with the scroll interactions
      can take some practice and trial and error. I’ve also found that GSAP
      animations work quite differently than D3 animations, so it can be
      tricky to mix these two. ScrollTrigger also has quite a bewildering array
      of options for configuration. This makes it far more flexible and powerful
      than most other scrollytelling libraries, but it also means that setting
      up animations can take some getting used to.
